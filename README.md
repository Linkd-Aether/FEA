# FEASprites

Hello and welcome to the repository for FEA, a JS Fire Emblem fan game loosely based off of Heroes, made for my Video Game Design class.
If you've found this repository, you're welcome to try out the game in whatever form it might be in.
If you want to contribute, feel free to make your own branch.

About the author:
I'm Jack M, or LinkedAether, a high school student! I've always loved coding and FE, so I've decided to make my own game.
Feel free to message me about this project or anything else I'm in.
