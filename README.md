# FEASprites

Hello and welcome to the repository for FEA, a JS Fire Emblem fan game loosely based off of Heroes, made for my Video Game Design class.
If you've found this repository, you're welcome to try out the game in whatever form it might be in.

About the author:
I'm Jack M, or LinkdAether, a student at WPI. This project is a small Tactical RPG demo in the style of Fire Emblem that relies on the CodeHS library.
